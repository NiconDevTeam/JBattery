# Welcome to JBattery! 

Hi, this is JBattery, a JavaSE app that I created some time ago because my laptop battery was damaged and my Linux (KDE or Gnome or ubuntu noo) never notified me when the battery was 100% and I spent hours with it. cable connected to the source, at the time my battery died, so I decided to create a system that will notify me when my battery was 100% full when it was half or when it was going to discharge, even my batteries kept dying but now at least I could see notifications of what was happening

## Requirements
In order to use JBattery you only need two things, soon it will only be one

 - Java >= 8
 - ACPI to install in debian based distributions **(sudo apt-get install acpi)**

## HOW TO
To run JBattery I do the following:

In the directory where I have JBattery.jar I open a terminal and execute
 - Java -jar Jbatter.jar
 - To see help from JBattery execute:  java -jar JBattery -h
 - To CHECK_MODE that evaluates the health of my battery i execute: java -jar JBattery.jar -c
that is all
